## UNotePad
A simple OpenUtau plugin to edit lyrics in a text editor.

OpenUtau doesn't have a builtin "find-and-replace" option for lyrics, So I made a plugin to call an external text editor (defaults to notepad) to do so. 

### How to use
1. Install UNotePad as how you install the other plugins on OpenUtau
2. Choose some notes in OpenUtau, press "Part -> Legacy Plugin -> Edit Lyric In Notepad"
3. A notepad window will pop up. Each line is the lyric of a note. Edit the lyrics, **Save** and close notepad.
